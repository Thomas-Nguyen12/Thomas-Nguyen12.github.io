Hi there, I am a 22-year-old MScR Biomolecular Science (Bioinformatics) Student passionate about all things A.I and Data Science! I am currently learning about time series analysis applied towards finance and stocks. 

I have worked on weather analysis and exchange rate projects which can be found <u>here</u>: 

- <b>Undergraduate penultimate year research project</b>: https://github.com/Thomas-Nguyen12/5023Y-Summative-2

- <b>Weather Dashboard:</b> https://thomas-website.streamlit.app/

- <b>Exchange Rate Dashboard:</b> https://gbp-rupiah-exchange.streamlit.app/

- <b>ATAC-Seq pipeline:</b> https://github.com/Thomas-Nguyen12/ATAC-Seq-Pipeline

In the future, I plan on learning more about how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning can be used to parse through news data and generate valuable summaries and predictions.
