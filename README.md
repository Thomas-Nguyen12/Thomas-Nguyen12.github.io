![image info][linkedin_picture.jpg]


Hi there, I am a 21-year-old MScR Biomolecular Science Student passionate about all things A.I and Data Science! I am currently learning about time series analysis applied towards finance and stocks. 

I have worked on weather analysis and exchange rate projects which can be found <u>here</u>: 

- <b>Undergraduate penultimate year research project</b>: https://github.com/Thomas-Nguyen12/5023Y-Summative-2

- <b>Weather Website:</b> https://weatherwebsite-e867owveht.streamlit.app/

- <b>Exchange Rate Website:</b> https://gbp-rupiah-exchange.streamlit.app/

In the future, I plan on learning more about how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning can be used to parse through news data and generate valuable summaries and predictions.
