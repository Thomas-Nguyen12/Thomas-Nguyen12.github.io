## About me 

![alt text](https://github.com/Thomas-Nguyen12/Thomas-Nguyen12.github.io/blob/main/images/linkedin_picture.JPG?raw=true)



Hi there, I am a 22-year-old MScR Biomolecular Science (Bioinformatics) Student passionate about all things A.I and Data Science! I am currently learning about time series analysis applied towards finance and stocks. 

I have worked on weather analysis and exchange rate projects which can be found <u>here</u>: 

### ☔ Weather Dashboard: ☔
A Dashboard app to visualise weather data and greenhouse emission trends over time - using M.L models to predict which countries have certain types and amounts of emissions --> https://thomas-website.streamlit.app/

### 📈 Exchange Rate Dashboard: 📉 
A dashboard app that tracks British Pound (GBP) to Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) exchange rates - performing time series analysis and applying several models to predict future trends --> https://gbp-rupiah-exchange.streamlit.app/ . Currently, this app needs to be updated manually. However, I am currently working on ways to update it in real time without relying on subscription services.

### 🔬 Undergraduate penultimate year research project: 🔬
This project is a study on how the Hesperia Comma flies can grow in response to climate change.  This study uses R to perform data cleaning, exploratory analysis and modelling tabular data using R and R markdown --> https://github.com/Thomas-Nguyen12/5023Y-Summative-2

### 📊 ATAC-Seq pipeline: 📊
A wrapper script to process raw .fastq files and determine the open regions of DNA in samples and find the statistically different regions between samples. This project implements data cleaning and modelling, error handling, and software development skills - intended as a comprehensive and easy-to-use script that performs the full analysis in one command --> https://github.com/Thomas-Nguyen12/ATAC-Seq-Pipeline
  
### 📊 RNA-Seq Pipeline: 📊
A wrapper script to process raw .fastq files, cleaning them and analysing them to investigate gene expression and find statistically different gene expression between samples. This project uses data cleaning, modelling - designed to implement a comprehensive and error-free analysis in one command --> https://github.com/Thomas-Nguyen12/RNA-Seq-Pipeline

## Upcoming Projects

- <b>News Classification website:</b> A dashboard app that can classify news categories, using web-scraping to collect news training data.

- <b>Loan Prediction Website:</b> A dashboard app to predict loan eligibility. Also leveraging Quarto for technical documents.

- <b>Language Translation App:</b> An App to translate words between English and Indonesian - applying transformer models and data cleaning techniques.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan on learning more about how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning can be used to parse through news data and generate valuable summaries and predictions.
